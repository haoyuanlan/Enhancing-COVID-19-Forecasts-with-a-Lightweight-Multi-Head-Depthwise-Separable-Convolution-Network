Please Note:

1. In each “Case” folder, the Excel file with “(used)”  contains the original results used by the CDSCnet, which is proposed in the paper *Enhancing COVID-19 Forecasts with a Lightweight Multi-Head Depthwise Separable Convolution Network*. The related figures and tables presented in the paper are all derived from this file.

2. The other Excel files  also contain results generated by CDSCnet. We selected the files named “(used)” for the paper because CDSCnet utilizes Keras’ default parameter initializers—such as “glorot_uniform” for 1D depthwise separable convolution—which involve randomness. Consequently, our methodology involved running the model five times. Results showing obvious anomalies caused by randomness were discarded and  re-run. Finally, to ensure the robustness, we we did not select the best results that might have arisen from randomness; this is why we chose the Excel files with the “(used)”.
