Please attension:

1. In each “Case” folder, the Excel file with “(used)”  contains the original results used by the CDSCnet, which is proposed in the paper "Enhancing COVID-19 Forecasts with a Lightweight Multi-Head Depthwise Separable Convolution Network". The related figures and tables presented in the paper are all derived from this file.

2. The other Excel files in the same folders also contain results generated by CDSCnet, but from different runs. Because CDSCnet relies on Keras’ default parameter initializers (e.g., “glorot_uniform” for 1D depthwise separable convolution), which introduce randomness. We ran the model five times, and any run that exhibited obvious anomalies attributable to random initialization was discarded and re‑executed. To ensure the robustness of our reported results, we did not select the best results that might have arisen from randomness; instead, we chose the representative results stored in the files named “(used)” as the basis for the paper’s figures and tables.

3. In each Excel file, the calculation results of metrics such as RMSE and MAE are provided in Sheet2 or Sheet3.
